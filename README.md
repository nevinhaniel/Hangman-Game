# Hangman Game

A simple Hangman game implemented in Python.

## Introduction

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. This project provides a basic implementation of the game with a focus on guessing U.S. states.

## Features

- Random selection of U.S. states as words to guess.
- Limited number of attempts.
- Basic ASCII art for visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iNoles/Hangman.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Hangman
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly select a U.S. state name as the word to guess.

2. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the letters in the word. 

3. Guess one letter at a time. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, you will lose one attempt.

4. Continue guessing letters until you think the entire word or run out of attempts.

5. If you guess the word within the given attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose the game.
